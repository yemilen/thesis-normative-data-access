The eFlint language is a domain-specific language developed for formalising norms. The theoretical foundations of the language are found in
transition systems and in Hohfeld’s framework of legal fundamental conceptions. The language can be used to formalize norms from a large variety
of sources. The resulting specifications are executable and support several forms of reasoning such as automatic case assessment, manual exploration
and simulation. Moreover, the specifications can be used to develop regulatory services for several types of monitoring, control and enforcement. This repository presents the use of the eFlint language for specifying data sharing agreements.
